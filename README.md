# 🧘‍♂️ YOG-AI: AI-Powered Yoga Posture Classification

**YOG-AI** (by Team Dash 2.0) is an AI-powered real-time yoga posture classification system designed to guide users during their yoga sessions. It uses machine learning to classify yoga poses based on body landmarks and provides audio feedback to help users correct their posture — all through WhatsApp, without the need for a heavy app setup.

## 🔥 Live Demo

> “You raise your hand… but no one tells you it’s 15° too high. That ends now.”

**YOG-AI** delivers real-time pose correction and coaching. Experience the future of AI fitness — no app needed.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a machine learning model that:

- Classifies yoga postures accurately.
- Works well in real-world, variable conditions.
- Supports fitness apps, posture tracking, and user wellness.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Pose Detection:** [MediaPipe BlazePose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10204) (33 body landmarks)
- **Classification Model:** Random Forest (lightweight, scalable)
- **Interface:** WhatsApp + Real-time Audio Feedback
- **Pipeline:**
  - ✅ Green pipes: Correct pose
  - ❌ Red pipes: Incorrect pose
